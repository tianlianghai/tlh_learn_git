# Learn git
This is my small project to learn git

1. create some initial file, and git init
2. add some image files, commit and push 
3. create a new branch
4. modify the readme
5. add another c.jpg image
6. commit and push the branch (you can find the the c.jpg is not pushed because untracked file is not committed by git commit -a)
7. push all changes in dev branch
8. go to master branch and merge (addition merge, there should be no conflict because master branch has no change since checkout to dev)
9. now I modify to create some different with master, and delete a file, then push the dev branch
