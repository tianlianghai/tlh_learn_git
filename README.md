# Learn git
This is my small project to learn git

1. create some initial file, and git init
2. add some image files, commit and push 
3. create a new branch
4. modify the readme
5. add another c.jpg image
6. commit and push the branch (you can find the the c.jpg is not pushed because untracked file is not committed by git commit -a)
